# Task Board
Interactive task board built with React and Redux. Supports drag and drop for moving tasks to different columns. Click on a task from the board to see an expanded task view.

When adding new tasks and moving tasks to different columns on the board, your task board state is saved to local storage to maintain a temporary task history. Use the clear button or manually clear local storage to reset stored task board state.

TODOs:
- [ ] Finish search functionality
- [ ] add button to save and clear task board to a specific file.
